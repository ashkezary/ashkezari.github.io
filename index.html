        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I studied computer science at Sharif University (2016-2020). Bioinformatics, Machine Learning, Data Science and Statistics were my major interests during my study.
        In addition, I had this opportunity to study Philosophy of Science alongside my bachelor's in CS.
        I carried on in the way and in 2023 I received my Master's in CS (Algorithms).
        Now I have a passion for Algorithms, Logic and Data Science. I am currently involved in a Text Mining project.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my academic journey, projects, and interests!</p>
